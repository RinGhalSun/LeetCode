    "# Two-Pointer in Linked List\n",
    "let's start with a classic problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have come up with the solution using the `hash table`. But there is a more efficient solution using `the two-pointer technique`. Try to think it over by yourself before reading the remaining content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine there are two runners with different speed. If they are running on a straight path,the fast runner will first arrive at the destination. However, if they are running on a circular track, the fast runner will catch up with the slow runner if they keep running.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's exactly what we will come across using two pointers with different speed in a linked list:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `If there is no cycle, the fast pointer will stop at the end of the linked list.`\n",
    "2. `If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet with the slow pointer.`\n",
    "\n",
    "So the only remaining problem is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> What should be the proper speed for the two pointer?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a safe choice to move the slow pointer `one step` at a time while moving the fast pointer `two steps` at a time. For each iteration, the fast pointer will move one extra step. If the length of cycle is *M* iterations, the faster pointer will definitely move one more cycle and catch up with the slow pointer.\n",
