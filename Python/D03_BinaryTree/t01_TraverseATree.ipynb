    "A `tree` is frequently-used data structure to simulate a hierarchical tree structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node of the tree will have a root value and a list of reference to other nodes which are called child nodes. From the graph view, a tree can also be defined as a directed acyclic graph which has `N nodes` and `N-1 edges`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Binary Tree` is one the most typical tree structure. As the name suggests, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has `at most two children`, which are referred to as the left child and right child.\n",

    "1. Understand the difference between different tree traversal methods\n",
    "2. Be able to solve pre-order, in-order, post-order traversal `recursively`\n",

    "In-order traversal is to traverse the left subtree first. Then visit the root. Finally traverse the right subtree.\n",

    "Also, post-order is widely use in mathematical expression. It is easier to write a program to parse a post-order expression. Here is an example:\n",

    "* Breadth First Search (`BFS`)\n",

    "    We scan through the tree level by level, following the order of height, from top to bottom. The nodes on higher level would be visited before the ones with lower levels.\n",

    "\n",
    "    The DFS strategy can further be distinguished as `preorder`, `inorder` and `postorder` depending on the relative order among the root node, left node and right node.\n",
