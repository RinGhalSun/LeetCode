    "___\n",
    "## Review\n",
    "Let's briefly review the performance of the linked list and doubly linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are similar in many operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Both of them are `not able to access the data at a random position` in constant time.\n",
    "2. Both of them can `add a new node after given node or at the beginning of the list in O(1) time`.\n",
    "3. Both of them can `delete the first node in O(1) time`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it is a little different to `delete a given node` (including the last node).\n",
    "\n",
    "* In a singly linked list, it is not able to get the previous node of a given node so we have to spend `O(N)` time to find out the previous node before deleting the given node.\n",
    "* In a doubly-linked list, it will be much easier because we can get the previous node with the \"prev\" reference field. So we can delete a given node in `O(1)` time.\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "## Comparison\n",
    "Here we provide a comparison of `time complexity` between the linked list and the array.\n",
    "<img src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/02/comparison_of_time_complexity.png\" style=\"height:250px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note: The given time complexities for the Doubly-Linked List assume that the Doubly-Linked List implementation keeps a reference to the tail node. If a reference to the tail node is not kept, then adding a node after the last node or deleting the last node would also require O(N) time.\n",
    "    \n",
    "After this comparison, it is not difficult to come up with our conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you need to add or delete a node frequently, a linked list could be a good choice\n",
    "    \n",

    "As simple as the problem might seem to be, it is actually not trivial(容易解决的) to write a solution that covers all cases,\n",
    "\n",
    "    Often the case for the problems with linked list, one could apply the approach of Two-Pointer Iteration, where one uses two pointers as surrogate(替代的) to traverse the linked list. \n",
    "    \n",
    "One of the reason of having two pointers rather than one is that in singly-linked list one does not have a reference to the precedent(前面的) node, therefore we keep an additional pointer which points to the precedent node.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For this problem, we iterate through the cyclic list using to pointers, namely prev and curr. When we find a suitable place to insert the new value, we insert it between the prev and curr nodes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "___\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "First of all, let us define the skeleton of two-pointers iteration algorithm as follows:\n",
    "* As we mentioned in the intuition, *we loop over* the linked list with two pointers (*i.e. `prev` and `curr`*) by step. The termination condition of the loop is that we get back to the starting point of the two pointers (*i.e. `prev == head`*)\n",
    "\n",
    "* During the loop, at each step, we check if the current place bounded by the two pointers it the right place to insert the new value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If not, we move both pointers one step forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the tricky part of this problem is to sort out different cases that our algorithm should deal with within the loop, and then design a *concise(简明的)* logic to handle them sound and properly. Here we break it down into *three* general cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Case 1). The value of new node sits between the minimal and maximal values of the current list. As a result, it should be inserted within the list.\n",

    "\n",
    "*The condition is to find the place that meets the constraint of `{prev.val <= insertVal <= curr.val}`*\n",
    "\n",

    "Firstly, we should locate the position of the **tail** node, by finding a descending order between the adjacent, *i.e.* the condition `{prev.val > curr.val}`, since the nodes are sorted in ascending order, the tail node would have the greatest value of all nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we check if the new value goes beyond the values of tail and head nodes, which are pointed by the `prev` and `curr` pointers respectively.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    ">Case 3). Finally, there is one case that does not fall into any of the above two cases. This is the case where the list contains uniform values.完全没想到这种情况,以后需要注意\n",
    "    \n",
    "Though not explicitly(明确的) stated in the problem description, our sorted list can contain some duplicate values. And in the extreme case, the entire list has only one single unique value.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Note that, we cannot skip the iteration though, since we have to iterate through the list to determine if our list contains a single unique value.**\n",

    "Instead of a separate dictionary to keep the old node --> new node mapping, we can tweak the original linked list and keep every cloned node next to its original node. The interweaving(交错) of old and new nodes allows us to solve this problem without any extra space.\n",

    "### Algorithm\n",
    "1. Traverse the original list and clone the nodes as you go and place the cloned next to its original node. This new linked list is essentially a interweaving of original and cloned nodes.\n",
